# 🌍 AidStack  
**Practical building blocks for humanitarian and civic technology.**  

## Why we exist  
Humanitarian organizations, NGOs, and civic institutions often struggle to build and ship digital products. Too often they rely on expensive vendors, outdated processes, or under-supported teams — resulting at times in fragile tools, or slow development cycles unable to keep up with new technologies and needs.

Shipping digital products is hard. In the private sector and fast-moving startups, practices exist to make it faster and more reliable — but these rarely reach NGOs. **AidStack brings that know-how into the humanitarian and civic space, without being a business or a startup — simply an open, shared effort in the spirit of FOSS.**  

Knowledge, technology, and practices should be shared as a commons — not hoarded. Our goal is to give NGOs, activists, academics, and journalists the ability to build products that are ethical, sustainable, resilient and relevant. And help them adopt them.

## Our mission  
- **Make digital products easier to start, adapt, and maintain.**  
- **Share open, reusable stacks** that organizations can build upon.  
- **Support teams and decision-makers** with playbooks, not just code.  
- **Strengthen capacity** across NGOs, academia, and civic tech.  

## What we build  
- **Starter kits** → ready-to-use templates and patterns.  
- **Reference stacks** → secure, ethical architectures for field or HQ use.  
- **Playbooks** → practical guidance for product management and engineering culture.  
- **Field tools** → digital solutions for communication, data, and analysis.

## Our stance  
We know building digital products in the humanitarian space is hard. Teams face pressure, resource gaps, and shifting priorities. But with the right building blocks, better processes, and a shared commons, it’s possible to build technology that lasts.  

> *AidStack is here to make that journey easier — practical, ethical, and open.*
